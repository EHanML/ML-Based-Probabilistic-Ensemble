# Simulation Study

## Simulation Description 

- AR1 simulation: M-closed case: ideal ensemble method should select the true model rather than combining all componenet learners. This data is the simulation used in the paper.

- VAR1 simulation: M-open case: ideal ensemble method should combnine component learners into a more powerful model. We also provide this simulation to illustrate power of probabilistic stacking method.


## Code Description

- Test_simulation_for_one_household: An AR1 model is firstly fitted using one household data (real-world data). The resulting coeffecients are used for AR1 process simulation.

- Sim_AR1: prepare the data used in this project. **Run this first!**

- SIm_VAR1: VAR1 process simulation. Additional data to play with.
